        <div class="details">
            KNOWN ABOUT THE AQUACULTURE PLANTS - Aquaculture involves the controlled cultivation of aquatic plants and animals using wastewater as a nutrient source. Aquaculture plant production utilizes methods like hydroponics and floating plant ponds, with advantages such as rapid growth, job creation, low capital costs, and continuous cultivation. However, challenges include space requirements and potential invasiveness of some plants.

        <div class="report-date">ON DAY 2:</div>
        <div class="details">
            AQUATIC PLANTS & HYDROPONIC VEGES - Aquatic plants thrive in water environments like lakes and ponds, providing oxygen, food, and shelter. Hydroponic vegetable plants, grown without soil in nutrient-rich water solutions, include lettuce, spinach, tomatoes, and herbs. Hydroponics offers controlled, space-efficient agriculture compared to traditional methods.
