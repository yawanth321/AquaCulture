            I Went to Sea Coastal Area & Find the problems – The sea coastal areas are close to a coastline or sea shore. The houses are near to the coastline. They are converting sea water to salt, but they are suffering for drinking water. Their houses are not permanent it may be collapse by floods.
            <ul>
                <li>Coasts will be exposed to increasing risks, including coastal erosion, over coming decades due to climate change and sea-level rise.</li>
                <li>Storms, flooding, and erosion are closely associated and can happen simultaneously.</li>
                <li>Destroying the quality of coastal resources that offer the city its distinct characteristics.</li>
                <li>Impacts on water quality.</li>
                <li>Decrease of opportunities for new urban infrastructure.</li>
                <li>Degraded public spaces.</li>
                <li>Lack of planning integration.</li>
            </ul>

            Known about Fishes & Types of Fishes –
            <ul>
                <li>Fish can be found in all bodies of water: lakes, rivers, seas, oceans, and ponds. In total, it is estimated that there are over 32,000 different species of fish worldwide.</li>
                <li>It is becoming clearer that humans are overfishing and destabilizing the marine ecosystem. Within the last century, over two-thirds of the population of predatory fishes, such as sharks, have also declined.</li>
                <li>Overall, there has been a decrease in both biodiversity and abundance irrespective of what marine ecosystem is observed.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>TYPES OF FISHES:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Saltwater Fishes:</strong> Saltwater fish, also called marine fish, are fish that live in seawater. Saltwater fish can swim and live alone or in a large group called a school. Saltwater fish are very commonly kept in aquariums for entertainment. Many saltwater fish are also caught to be eaten or grown in aquaculture.</li>
                <li><strong>Freshwater Fishes:</strong> Freshwater fish are those that spend some or all of their lives in fresh water, such as rivers and lakes, with a salinity of less than 1.05%. These environments differ from marine conditions in many ways, especially the difference in levels of salinity. To survive in fresh water, the fish need a range of physiological adaptations. These fishes are caught to be eaten.</li>
            </ul>

            Visited the Aqua Feeds & Chemicals – Aquafeeds refer to any feed given to aquatic farmed animals as part of aquaculture. Fish (both farmed and wild) require a balanced mix of essential nutrients such as amino acids, fatty acids, and vitamins to thrive. Manufactured feeds are an important part of modern commercial aquaculture, providing the balanced nutrition needed by farmed fish. The feeds, in the form of granules or pellets, provide the nutrition in a stable and concentrated form, enabling the fish to feed efficiently and grow to their full potential.
            <ul>
                <li>Fish meal, Dry fish, Soybean meal, Meat and bone meal, Rape seed cake, Mustard oil cake, Soy protein concentrate, Blood meal, Krill meal, Maize gluten.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>AQUA CHEMICALS takes the time to understand your exact needs before recommending a chemical treatment program for industrial cooling systems. A full system audit, which includes operational history and inefficiencies, allows your field engineer to determine the potential for corrosion, fouling, and scaling within your cooling system.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Descaling Chemical. Boiler Descaling Chemical. Descaling Chemical CLEACHEM POWDER.</li>
                <li>Polyelectrolyte Chemical. Anionic Poly-electrolyte Powder AQ-8100. Magi floc Powder/liquid.</li>

        <div class="details">
            Visited the Sea Food Transportation – We interacted with the transportation service. There were many transportation vehicles loaded with the bulk of fishes to export. Fish transportation is a process by which fish are transported from one place to another in a scientific way.
            <ul>
                <li>It plays an important role in the distribution of quality fish fry among a country or even the world.</li>
                <li>Fishes are transported mainly for three purposes:
                    <ul>
                        <li>For breeding purposes</li>
                        <li>Stocking in nursery ponds</li>
                        <li>For selling purposes</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

            Known about Pet Fishes – Fish are popular pets, and some kinds are easy to take care of. Pet fish are kept in a glass tank called an aquarium. Some fish come from warm waters, so the aquarium needs an underwater heater that automatically switches on and off to keep the temperature of the water just right. Fishkeeping is a popular hobby, practiced by aquarists, concerned with keeping fish in a home aquarium or garden pond. There is also a piscicultural fishkeeping industry, serving as a branch of agriculture.

            Went to the Fishes Aquarium – An aquarium is a vivarium of any size having at least one transparent side in which aquatic plants or animals are kept and displayed. Fish keepers use aquaria to keep fish, invertebrates, amphibians, aquatic reptiles, such as turtles, and aquatic plants. Ensure all pumps, filters, and lights are working properly. Observe fish for negative side effects. If any side effects are evident, test the water immediately. If the water is fine but the fish remain ill, check the filters and pumps for any malfunctions. Remove excess food from the tank. I also started the growing of fishes in aquarium with some pebbles and feeding food. They are being beautiful in the room corner.
