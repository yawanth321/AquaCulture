            INTRODUCTION TO AQUACULTURE – Aquaculture involves cultivating freshwater, brackish water and saltwater populations under controlled or semi-natural conditions, and can be contrasted with commercial fishing, which is the harvesting of wild fish. Aquaculture can b conducted in completely artificial facilities built on land, as in the case of fish tanks, ponds, aquaponics or raceways, where the living conditions rely on human control such as water quality, feed, temperature.

            WHY AQUACULTURE IS IMPORTANT – Aquaculture is also one of the world's most efficient and sustainable methods to produce high-quality protein. The industry has a low carbon footprint and feed conversion ratio as well as high protein and energy retention. Skretting provides innovative and sustainable nutritional solutions that best support the performance of farmed fish and shrimp.
